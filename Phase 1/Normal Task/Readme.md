expense handling project

It would be a better experience if it is run on full width (1920) instead of half screen since the components are centered in such a way that they are more visually appealing on full width

#HOW IT WORKS:
-- Getting Started:

When you start the program, it's ready to manage expenses for multiple users.

--Menu Options:

You see a menu with choices like adding a user, adding an expense, checking balances, or exiting.

--Adding Users:

If you choose to add a user, you type in their name. The program lets you know if the user was successfully added or if they already exist.

--Adding Expenses:

For adding expenses, you specify who paid, how much, and who benefited. The program checks if everyone involved exists as users. If so, it records the expense.

--Checking Balances:

When you want to see balances, the program calculates how much each person owes or is owed based on recorded expenses. It then displays this information.

--Exiting:

If you decide to exit, the program stops running.
