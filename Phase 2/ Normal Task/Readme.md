SIMPLE WEB CLOCK

#HOW TO RUN
- I would advise to open all files (html, CSS & .py) in your preferred IDE
- Run the Python file and Click on the link (Running on ...)

#ABOUT
- Simple web clock which can be accessed using web browsers.
- Made using Flask and the meta tag to make it change time dynamically rather than using Javascript for the same.
